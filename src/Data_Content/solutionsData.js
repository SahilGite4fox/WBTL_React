      `Braking solutions are crucial for passenger safety and comfort. Ineffective braking systems can endanger lives and can make even a short ride uncomfortable and unsafe especially in the start-and-stop traffic in cities. OEMs are now equipping their offerings with the latest technologies. These include EPB (electric parking brake), Wire-Controlled Brake System (WCBS), ABS (Anti-lock Braking Systems), AEB (Automatic Emergency Braking), and ADAS that offer enhanced safety and control. Such technologies are increasingly favored by demanding customers.`,
      `Indian OEMs now offer the latest braking systems in top-end models with over 70 India-made models being ADAS-equipped. Being able to offer these world-class technologies at cost-effective rates enables OEMs to price their products competitively. In the future, one can expect cars in lower priced segments to come with advanced and globally-tested braking solutions. WBTL India’s product range caters a wide range for cars from small hatchbacks to SUVs and sedans. We have one of the widest portfolios of upgraded braking solutions, that are compact and combine several functions. They have been validated and tested for all passenger vehicles segments.`

      `SUVs require distinct braking solutions from those in hatchbacks and sedans because they handle significantly greater demands. This is primarily because their braking function involves a higher degree of energy conversion than conventional cars and requires better heat dissipation to prevent a reduction in effective braking due to overheating.`,
      `SUVs are heavier than sedans. With their 4WD capabilities, heavier tyres, higher ground clearance and larger interior space, this greater mass translates into higher kinetic energy that has to be dissipated during braking. Moreover, if an SUV has been designed to carry heavy payloads or has a towing feature, this further increases the vehicle’s overall weight, placing even more strain on the braking systems.`,
      `India’s car market is dominated by compact SUVs that typically weigh between 1100 kgs and 1600 kgs. From the hilly regions to plateau, katcha roads made purely of earthen materials, and coastal roads, our braking solutions for SUVs have been designed and validated to provide top-class braking in varied and challenging driving conditions. Our cost-effective solutions have been validated for Indian cars and our driving conditions. Our solutions offer a safe and comfortable driving experience.`
